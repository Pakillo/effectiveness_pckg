abundance-          Mean no. birds censused/km, averaged for two study years.

visits-             Mean no. visitis recorded to fruiting trees (/10 h).

prop_visits-        Proportion of total visits recorded (feeding records)
                    contributed by species. Relative to the total no. 
                    records in two study years.
