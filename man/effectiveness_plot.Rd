\item{group}{a grouping variable to set point shapes (e.g., family).}

\item{label}{a label for the individual points (e.g., spcies acronym).}

\item{nlines}{specify the number of isolines.}

\item{myxlab}{optional label for axis X.}

\item{myylab}{optional label for axis Y.}

\examples{
# Based on a dataset of Prunus mahaleb frugivores.
# In this example we build the effectiveness landscape just for the 
# quantitative component, plotting its two subcomponents, visitation 
# rate and per-visit effectiveness.
