Description: A function for plotting the effectiveness landscape of mutualisms
    adding isolines of equal effectiveness values. Effectiveness landscapes
    are the two-dimensional representation of the possible combinations of the
    quantity and the quality of mutualistic services (seed dispersal, pollination)
    and with elevational contours representing isoclines of effectiveness. These
    representations can be 2D bivariate plots of multiplicative effects of any of
    the seed dispersal (SDE) or pollination (PE) effectiveness components. This is a
    repository of code used to produce these plots.
